	<h2>East New York had more injuries from motor vehicle crashes this year than any neighborhood in the city.</h2>

<h3>By Rhiannon Rashidi</h3>

<p>Dec. 18-- East New York is a primarily residential waterfront neighborhood in Brooklyn. Its housing sits below the borough's average prices, and small family-owned businesses characterize its commercial streets. According to the NYPD, it is also the neighborhood you are most likely to be injured in a motor vehicle accident. </p>

<p>Brooklyn averaged 315 people injured in motor vehicle crashes per zip code this year. That number is 40% higher than the Bronx, the borough with the next highest average number of people injured. Zip codes within and directly bordering the East New York neighborhood had the highest number of reported injuries. One zip code in the neighborhood had 917 reported injuries, over 600 more than the borough average. </p>

<p> "[The NYPD data] shows that the most common reasons for motor vehicle accidents reported in Brooklyn were driver inattention, failure to yeild to right-of-way and tailgating," said Kyeko M. Stewart, an associate attorney at Platta Law Firm.
